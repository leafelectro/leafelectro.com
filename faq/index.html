    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2 class="brand-color">What DAW, synths, plugins are you using?</h2>
    <p>Ableton Live on OSX. I resample wavetables from various synths and loop them through a sampler to avoid using any third-party plugin. The only plugins I use are iZotope Ozone's Imager for stereo width, ValhallaRoom for reverb, and A.O.M's Invisible Limiter.</p>

    <h2 class="brand-color">Can I use or promote your music on my YouTube channel?</h2>
    <p>Yes you can, as long as you mention where the music comes from, or don't try to make it look like you made it. Ideally, have a link to my <a href="http://leaf.im/soundcloud">SoundCloud page</a> or to this site in your description, but at the very least make sure "Leaf - [song name]" is written somewhere.</p>

    <h2 class="brand-color">Can I remix your songs?</h2>
    <p>I would love that! On the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/music">Music</a> section of this site, you will find links to download remix stems, MIDI files, and screenshots, to help you getting started with your remix.</p>

    <h2 class="brand-color">Can we collab? Can you share my track/mix?</h2>
    <p>As much as I love discovering new musicians, I am not planning on doing any collaboration work at the moment, as I'm still trying to find my own style. I also won't share your tracks on my SoundCloud page, that would certainly bother my followers!</p>

    <h2 class="brand-color">What's up with all these ads?</h2>
    <p>The reason you've heard about me might be because you've seen an ad / sponsored link somewhere. Getting heard in this saturated field is difficult and ads are one of the communication media I've chosen to get my music to your ears. I apologize if they bothered you, and would recommend installing <a target="_blank" href="https://getadblock.com/">AdBlock</a> in your browser to hide them.</p>
