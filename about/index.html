    <h1>About Leaf</h1>

    <p>
        Hey there! I am a 26 years old French music producer from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@48.8588897,2.3396392,13z">Paris, France</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been playing drums and guitar for the past 15-ish years and had many rock and metal bands.</p>

    <p>
        I'm also a Front-End Engineer, and you can find the code of this website and my leaf.im URL shortening service on <a target="_blank" href="github.com/leafelectro">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Yes you can, as long as you mention where the music comes from, or don't try to make it look like you made it. Ideally, have a link to my <a target="_blank" href="http://leaf.im/soundcloud">SoundCloud page</a> or to this site in your description, but at the very least make sure "Leaf - [song name]" is written somewhere.</p>
